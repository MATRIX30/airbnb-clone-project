- **MySQL** – A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data efficiently.

### Version Control & Collaboration
- **GitHub** – A platform for repository management, version control, and team collaboration.

### Containerization & Deployment
- **Docker** – A containerization tool that simplifies application deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **GitHub Actions** – A CI/CD tool that automates testing and deployment processes.

### Security & Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – A mechanism for secure user authentication and session management.


## Database Design

The **Airbnb Clone Project** database is structured using a relational model to efficiently manage bookings, properties, users, and transactions. Below are the key entities, their fields, and their relationships.

### Key Entities

#### 1. Users
Stores information about registered users, including guests and hosts.
- **id** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each user.
- **name** – Full name of the user.
- **email** – Unique email address for login.
- **role** – Defines whether the user is a host or guest.
- **created_at** – Timestamp of account creation.

#### 2. Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.
- **id** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each property.
- **host_id** (Foreign Key) – References the `Users` table to associate a property with its owner.
- **title** – Name or title of the property.
- **location** – Address or general location of the property.
- **price_per_night** – Cost for a single night stay.

#### 3. Bookings
Tracks reservations made by guests.
- **id** (Primary Key) – Unique booking ID.
- **user_id** (Foreign Key) – References the `Users` table to associate a booking with a guest.
- **property_id** (Foreign Key) – References the `Properties` table to link the booking to a property.
- **check_in_date** – The start date of the booking.
- **check_out_date** – The end date of the booking.

#### 4. Reviews
Stores feedback left by guests about their stay.
- **id** (Primary Key) – Unique identifier for each review.
- **user_id** (Foreign Key) – References the `Users` table to associate a review with a guest.
- **property_id** (Foreign Key) – References the `Properties` table to associate a review with a property.
- **rating** – Numerical rating given by the guest.
- **comment** – Text feedback about the stay.

#### 5. Payments

### Entity Relationships
- A **user** can list multiple **properties** as a host.
- A **guest** can book multiple **properties** over time.
- A **booking** is associated with one **property** and one **guest**.
- A **review** belongs to a **user** and a **property**.
- A **payment** is tied to a **booking** and a **user**.
